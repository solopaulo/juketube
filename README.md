An old youtube audio streamer with web front end written in jquery ui

Written for Play! Framework 1.x

Uses python program youtube-dl to find the URL to the media stream from youtube (will need updating)

I wrote this for my home PVR so I could queue up tracks from youtube to play through my hi-fi
